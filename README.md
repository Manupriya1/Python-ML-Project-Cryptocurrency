# UCB-Cryptocurrency-ML-Project

I used unsupervised for this project to help my client Martha to decide about investing in new cryptocurrencies. We know Bitcoin and its popularity which causes a price jump and makes it unaffordable to new investors, but there are other cryptocurrencies which are more affordable. I used clustering and the K-means algorithm for unsupervised machine learning that enabled me to find groups and patterns in my data. I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data reduction.

# Overview: 
In this Project, I analyzed various cryptocurrencies that are currently trading using unsupervised machine learning.  I performed
- PCA analysis
- predicted clusters
- ploted 3d plots for results.
